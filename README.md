## Writeup for Script Kiddie

**Challenge Description:**
Are you a script kiddie or a math god?
`nc c1.2021.gryphonctf.com 9007`

Connecting to the host and port, we can see the following output:

```
Welcome math god! You will be given several questions and you have 5 seconds to solve each question for the flag! Good luck! :P
Solve [x] ADD [y]
>
```

So based on this, we can write a script to parse the data input.
